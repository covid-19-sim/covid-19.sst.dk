# Comments on data

The *Tested*, *Confirmed* and *Death count* seems to be registered by number at midnight. That is numbers of tested, confirmed and deaths occured during a specific calendar day.
The other numbers are published around 13:00 or 14:00 every day, so that is most likely the correct valid number at noon (12:00) every day.
So there is most likely a timeshift in the death count by approximately 12 hours.
